    "Ensemble techniques are used in machine learning for several reasons due to the benefits they offer. Here are some key reasons why ensemble techniques\n",

    "\n",
    "Improved predictive performance: Ensemble techniques have the potential to achieve higher accuracy and better generalization compared to individual\n",
    "models. By combining the predictions of multiple models, ensemble methods can effectively leverage the collective wisdom of the models, capture \n",
    "diverse patterns in the data, and reduce the impact of individual model biases or weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduction of bias and variance: Ensemble techniques can help reduce bias and variance in predictions. Bias refers to the error caused by overly \n",
    "simplistic assumptions or limitations of individual models, while variance refers to the sensitivity of a model to small fluctuations in the training \n",
    "data. Ensemble methods can mitigate these issues by combining models with different biases and reducing the variance through aggregation or weighted \n",

    "\n",
    "Robustness to noise and outliers: Ensemble techniques tend to be more robust to noisy or outlier data points. The ensemble can average out the errors\n",
    "introduced by individual models or outliers, leading to more stable and reliable predictions. By incorporating multiple perspectives, ensemble methods\n",
    "can filter out noisy signals and focus on the underlying patterns in the data.\n",

    "limitations in representing complex patterns, but by combining multiple models, ensemble methods can capture different aspects of the data, \n",
    "non-linear relationships, and interactions among features. This allows them to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased model stability: Ensemble techniques provide stability to the modeling process. By training multiple models and aggregating their \n",
    "predictions, ensemble methods reduce the impact of model initialization, random fluctuations in the training data, or small changes in the \n",
    "model's hyperparameters. This stability can improve the reliability and reproducibility of the modeling results."

    "is trained on its respective bootstrap sample, resulting in multiple models with potentially different sets of learned patterns and relationships.\n",
