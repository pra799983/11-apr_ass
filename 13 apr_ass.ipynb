    "Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through several mechanisms inherent in its algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Subsampling: Random Forest Regressor employs bootstrap sampling, which involves randomly selecting subsets of the training data with \n",
    "replacement. This means that each decision tree in the ensemble is trained on a slightly different set of data instances. This random subsampling \n",
    "helps to introduce diversity in the training process and reduce the risk of overfitting to specific data points or noise in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Feature Selection: In addition to sampling the data, Random Forest Regressor also randomly selects a subset of features at each node of the \n",
    "decision trees. By considering only a subset of features for splitting, the algorithm reduces the chances of individual features dominating the\n",
    "tree's decisions. This random feature selection further enhances the diversity of the ensemble and reduces overfitting by preventing any single \n",
    "feature from exerting excessive influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble Averaging: The key aspect of Random Forest Regressor is the aggregation of predictions from multiple decision trees in the ensemble. Rather\n",
    "than relying on a single decision tree's prediction, the final prediction is typically an average or a weighted average of the predictions made by\n",
    "all the individual trees. Averaging the predictions helps to smooth out noise and outliers, reducing the likelihood of overfitting to specific \n",
    "instances and enhancing the generalization capability of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization: The Random Forest Regressor algorithm inherently incorporates regularization through the use of maximum depth or maximum number of \n",
    "leaf nodes per tree. By limiting the depth of the trees, the model's complexity is controlled, preventing the individual decision trees from growing \n",
    "too deep and memorizing the training data. This regularization constraint helps in mitigating overfitting by promoting simpler and more generalizable\n",

    "Aggregating Predictions: After obtaining the predictions from all the decision trees, Random Forest Regressor combines them to generate the final \n",

    "Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor are both machine learning algorithms used for regression tasks, but they differ in several ways:\n",

    "Diversity: Decision Tree Regressor typically has low diversity as it is trained on the entire training dataset. Random Forest Regressor introduces\n",
